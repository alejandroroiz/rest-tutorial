# [Base22 Spring Rest API Tutorial](https://base22.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~Alejandro.Roiz/pages/9601034/Learn+how+to+create+a+RESTful+Service+Using+Spring+Boot)
The Rest API Tutorial is an effort realized by Alejandro Roiz and Diego Contreras to aid the Backend Developer Onboarding process.


## Quick start
Utilize the starting configuration described on the tutorial for bootstrapping your application.


## Features
The application is a Spring Boot based Restful Service. It does NOT contain a front-end and never will.
The application follows the simple workflow of creating a user and authenticating it for a restful service. It serves as a starting point for all the rest api concepts, as well as Java and Spring concepts.


## Documentation
Take a look at the [documentation in Base22 wiki](https://base22.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~Alejandro.Roiz/pages/9601034/Learn+how+to+create+a+RESTful+Service+Using+Spring+Boot). 
The documentation is in a guide format which explains the technical details of the solution and deep dives into the code itself.
